<p>The figures and inconveniences are facts. The MTA carries out work on rails and platforms on weekends. This is a great nuisance for people in the sector when visiting their families, working overtime or taking advantage of the time to spend with their children. The 7 train is improving its performance; but for these fixes to occur, sacrifices have to be made especially before winter comes, which is when delays on platforms are not only uncomfortable but dangerous.

According to the MTA, 54% of subway delays are caused by signal, track and power issues, with the remaining delays caused my medical, fire, car, water and station problems. Current plans to increase train speed should continue to chip at the wait times and delays, coupled with efforts to modernize the system and improve platform accessibility for those with children or with disabilities.

<p>According to the MTA, Additional Platform Time (APT) refers to “The estimated average time that customers spend waiting at a station beyond their scheduled wait time.” In September 2019, the 7 train was classified by the MTA as the best train service with 96% on time service. This was after having had one of the worst months in August 2019, when commuters clocked in APT of 2.44 minutes during peak hours and 1.07 during off-peak hours. In September 2019, however, APT on the 7 train was .70, which beat the .76 APT of the W train, MTA’s best train.

Queens residents should be encouraged, because the average APT of the 7 train has declined by 17% since 2018 and has continued to decline month over month in 2019, although exceptions may randomly occur. Photo Benjamin Chambers.

			<img src="images/burning5.png">	  After five years of photographing this unique community, I have come to understand the concept of radical inclusion, all are welcome and accepted at Black Rock. In the world of "Burning Man" I observed and captured colorful citizens, loving and open people, sunrises, sunsets, landscapes natural and man-made, all presenting an alternative world, an experiment free of religious ties, bureaucratic border patrols, political barriers, conspicuous consumerism, where all are welcome. It is a world in which we are each different, but interdependent, where we need much less than what we have to survive with dignity. Black Rock offers a refuge, an awakening in which we can educate, dance, create and be happy without losing sight of what really matters, life in freedom with others.</div></div> -->
